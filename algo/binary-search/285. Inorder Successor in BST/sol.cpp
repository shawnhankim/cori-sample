285. Inorder Successor in BST

Medium

Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.

 

Example 1:

     2
    / \
   1   3

Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.


Example 2:

          5
         / \
        3   6
       / \
      2   4
     /
    1

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
 

Note:

If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.
It's guaranteed that the values of the tree are unique.
