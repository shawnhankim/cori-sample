Create self-signed TLS certificates – PKCS8 key and x509 cert

#Generate new key and create a self signed certificate:
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout selfsigned.key.pem -out selfsigned-x509.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=WA/L=Seattle/CN=example.com/emailAddress=someEmail@gmail.com"

Output:

selfsigned.key.pem  –  PEM Key
selfsigned-x509.crt –  x509 Certificate


#Convert PEM key to PKCS8 format:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in selfsigned.key.pem -out selfsigned-pkcs8.pem
Ouptut:

selfsigned-pkcs8.pem – PKCS formatted key
